# Workdayscheduler

This work day scheduler has a basic style
This work day scheduler displays the current date at the top of the page. The scheduler uses the moment.js API. 
When I scroll down the page, timeblocks for standard hours are displayed. 
When I click on these time blocks I am able to enter an event. 
When I click the + button I am able to save the event in local storage.
When I refresh the page, the saved event displays.
